3 peppers, cut into thick strips
4 sprigs fresh thyme 
2 tbsp olive oil 
2 tbsp red wine vinegar","Preheat the oven to 200?øC, fan 180?øC, gas 6. To joint the chicken, start by sitting it on a chopping board, breast-side down. Using a sharp knife, make a shallow cut all the way along the backbone. Look to see where the legs join the back of the chicken (there will be a horizontal band of whitish fat beneath the skin) and make a horizontal cut here. You will have made a cross shape.
Turn the chicken back over and pull the legs away from the body, snapping or loosening the thigh joint if you can to help release the entire leg later. Cut through the skin where the legs meet the body, then cut around the leg and thigh, following the shape of the birdƒ??s ribcage, to remove each whole leg. This is where those first cuts into the backbone will help to separate the leg cleanly. Be sure to include the ƒ??oysterƒ?? which is the piece of flesh where the leg is attached to the body, about the size of the fleshy base of your thumb. You will need to carefully cut around the oyster where it attached to the body, keeping each one with its corresponding leg.
Break the leg tips by bending them back on themselves firmly and cut through the skin to release them, leaving the drumstick bone exposed on each leg. Now separate the drumstick from the thigh, cutting through the diagonal line of fat and snapping the joint before cutting through it completely. You should be left with two thighs with oysters attached and two drumsticks.
Remove the breasts from the carcass. Starting on one side of the breastbone (the prominent bone between the two breasts), follow the shape of the carcass closely to get as much flesh off as possible and gradually cut the breast away to just above where the legs used to be. Using very strong scissors or poultry shears, cut through the ribs that the breast remains attached to. Turn the chicken over and cut along the line of fat at the base of the breast with the scissors, releasing it completely with the wing still attached to the breast. Repeat on the other side.
Slice through each breast on the diagonal, so that one portion has the wing joint attached and one portion is breast only. Use the carcass for chicken stock if you wish (carcasses can be frozen in freezer bags ready to make a batch of stock when convenient).
Put the chicken pieces in a large baking dish or sturdy roasting tin with the red onion, peppers and thyme sprigs. Toss with olive oil and season with salt and pepper, making sure the chicken pieces are roughly nestled on top, skin-side up.

2 tbsp red wine vinegar","Preheat the oven to 200?øC, fan 180?øC, gas 6. To joint the chicken, start by sitting it on a chopping board, breast-side down. Using a sharp knife, make a shallow cut all the way along the backbone. Look to see where the legs join the back of the chicken (there will be a horizontal band of whitish fat beneath the skin) and make a horizontal cut here. You will have made a cross shape.
Turn the chicken back over and pull the legs away from the body, snapping or loosening the thigh joint if you can to help release the entire leg later. Cut through the skin where the legs meet the body, then cut around the leg and thigh, following the shape of the birdƒ??s ribcage, to remove each whole leg. This is where those first cuts into the backbone will help to separate the leg cleanly. Be sure to include the ƒ??oysterƒ?? which is the piece of flesh where the leg is attached to the body, about the size of the fleshy base of your thumb. You will need to carefully cut around the oyster where it attached to the body, keeping each one with its corresponding leg.
Break the leg tips by bending them back on themselves firmly and cut through the skin to release them, leaving the drumstick bone exposed on each leg. Now separate the drumstick from the thigh, cutting through the diagonal line of fat and snapping the joint before cutting through it completely. You should be left with two thighs with oysters attached and two drumsticks.
Remove the breasts from the carcass. Starting on one side of the breastbone (the prominent bone between the two breasts), follow the shape of the carcass closely to get as much flesh off as possible and gradually cut the breast away to just above where the legs used to be. Using very strong scissors or poultry shears, cut through the ribs that the breast remains attached to. Turn the chicken over and cut along the line of fat at the base of the breast with the scissors, releasing it completely with the wing still attached to the breast. Repeat on the other side.
Slice through each breast on the diagonal, so that one portion has the wing joint attached and one portion is breast only. Use the carcass for chicken stock if you wish (carcasses can be frozen in freezer bags ready to make a batch of stock when convenient).
Put the chicken pieces in a large baking dish or sturdy roasting tin with the red onion, peppers and thyme sprigs. Toss with olive oil and season with salt and pepper, making sure the chicken pieces are roughly nestled on top, skin-side up.

For the pumpkin filling, place the pumpkin, vegetable oil and seasoning in a bowl and toss to coat. Spread the pumpkin pieces out on a roasting tray and roast for 20-25 minutes until golden.
When the pumpkin is soft and cooked, place in a bowl and use a masher or fork to remove any lumps and create a smooth paste. Add salt and pepper and mix well.
Begin the white sauce by getting your little ones to stud the onion and garlic with cloves. Place in a saucepan along with the milk, salt and bay leaves. Simmer for 10 minutes so that the flavours can infuse.
Melt the butter in a separate pan over a medium heat. Add the plain flour and mix well to form a paste (roux). Cook the mixture out for 2 minutes. Strain in the infused milk, ensuring you whisk continuously.










						
					





Cook over a gentle heat until it thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon; it should be thinner than a normal white sauce. Adjust the seasoning as desired.
To make the spinach filling, bring salted water to the boil in a large pan. Blanch the spinach for 30 seconds, and then strain and transfer to a colander resting in iced water.










						
					





Once the spinach is cool, squeeze to remove any excess water; the kids can help with this! Then chop into small pieces and leave aside.
Combine the spinach, cream cheese, nutmeg and salt and pepper in a small bowl. Mix well and set aside.
To make the tomato sauce, add the vegetable oil to the pan and set over a medium heat. When hot, cook the onion and garlic until golden-brown.
Add the vinegar to the pan to de-glaze, then add in the rest of the sauce ingredients. Leave the sauce to simmer for 5 minutes.










						
					





Fit large round nozzles onto 2 piping bags. Fill one bag with the pumpkin mash and the other with the spinach mix. Get your little ones to pipe the pumpkin mash into one end of the cannelloni from the middle out. Fill the other half of each cannelloni tube with the spinach mix.
Lay the cannelloni into a baking dish and pour the tomato sauce over the pasta. Pour over the white sauce, scatter over the Emmental and the toasted pumpkin seeds, then bake in the oven for 45-60 minutes ƒ?? until cooked through (al dente).

Place the butter onto a board and bash with a rolling pin until it is approx. 26cm wide, 10cm in length and 1cm deep. Place in the middle of the dough and make sure there is a 2cm border. Leave a 1cm border at the sides clear of butter, so that it doesnƒ??t spill from the sides of the pastry during rolling










						
					















						
					




.
Fold the butter-free part of the dough over the middle third, then fold the remaining, unbuttered third over to make a flat parcel (like folding a letter into 3 to put inside an envelope). Lightly press down the open ends to seal, then chill, covered in cling film, for 15 minutes. Remove the cling film and lay the dough on a floured surface with the short side facing you. Roll out in one direction. Youƒ??ll get a very long rectangle ƒ?? donƒ??t worry as the next time you roll the dough it will be a more manageable size. As before, fold the bottom third of pastry over the middle third, then fold the top third over. Wrap in cling film and chill for 15 minutes more. Repeat the rolling and folding process 1 more time, but this time start the dough on the floured surface with the longest side facing you. Allow the dough to rest in the fridge for another 15 minutes.
Repeat steps 5 and 6, so youƒ??ve rolled the dough into a long rectangle 4 times. Wrap the dough with cling film and chill overnight until firm. Trim the edges; the dough is now ready to make Almond custard Danish pastries or croissants. Preheat the oven to 200?øC/fan180?øC/gas 6. Line a baking sheet with nonstick baking paper. Roll out the pastry to a 5mm thickness and cut into 12 x 10cm squares. Place a generous tablespoon of custard into the middle, then brush the edges of pastry with beaten egg and fold the pastry corners into the centre to enclose the filling. Place the pastries on a lined baking sheet.
Chill, covered in cling film, for 20 minutes. Brush each pastry with the beaten egg, scatter with flaked almonds and bake for 15-18 minutes or until puffed up and until golden brown. Meanwhile, whisk the icing sugar, milk and almond extract together in a small bowl until it forms a thick but pourable icing and set aside. Cool the pastries for 5-10 minutes, drizzle with the icing and serve.

Line two large baking sheets with nonstick baking paper. Put the egg whites in a large, very clean, non-plastic mixing bowl and whisk for 2-3 mins until soft peaks form.

Tip out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 minutes dusting with more flour as necessary until the dough is smooth and the surface is slightly springy to touch and not sticky. Place into a lightly oiled bowl and cover with lightly oiled cling film and leave in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size. On a lightly floured board, roll out into a 5mm thick rectangle about 30cm x 40cm with the shorter side facing you. Place the butter onto a board and bash with a rolling pin until it is approx. 26cm wide, 10cm in length and 1cm deep. Place in the middle of the dough and make sure there is a 2cm border.

.
Fold the butter-free part of the dough over the middle third, then fold the remaining, unbuttered third over to make a flat parcel (like folding a letter into 3 to put inside an envelope). Lightly press down the open ends to seal, then chill, covered in cling film, for 15 minutes. Remove the cling film and lay the dough on a floured surface with the short side facing you. Roll out in one direction. Youƒ??ll get a very long rectangle ƒ?? donƒ??t worry as the next time you roll the dough it will be a more manageable size. As before, fold the bottom third of pastry over the middle third, then fold the top third over. Wrap in cling film and chill for 15 minutes more. Repeat the rolling and folding process 1 more time, but this time start the dough on the floured surface with the longest side facing you. Allow the dough to rest in the fridge for another 15 minutes.
Repeat steps 5 and 6, so youƒ??ve rolled the dough into a long rectangle 4 times. Wrap the dough with cling film and chill overnight until firm. Trim the edges; the dough is now ready to make Almond custard Danish pastries or croissants. Preheat the oven to 200?øC/fan180?øC/gas 6. Line a baking sheet with nonstick baking paper. Roll out the pastry to a 5mm thickness and cut into 12 x 10cm squares. Place a generous tablespoon of custard into the middle, then brush the edges of pastry with beaten egg and fold the pastry corners into the centre to enclose the filling. Place the pastries on a lined baking sheet.
Chill, covered in cling film, for 20 minutes. Brush each pastry with the beaten egg, scatter with flaked almonds and bake for 15-18 minutes or until puffed up and until golden brown. Meanwhile, whisk the icing sugar, milk and almond extract together in a small bowl until it forms a thick but pourable icing and set aside.
